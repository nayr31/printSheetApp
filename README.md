## printSheetApp

This is a shiny app that allows printing of character sheets created by Walter
Kammerer's Fifth Edition Character Sheet. 

It uses functions from 
[import5eChar](https://github.com/oganm/import5eChar) package to read and export
PDFs. So if you actually want to see what's happening under the hood, that's where
you want to look.
